# DC-Simulation
Using finite element method for calculating direct current method in Geoelectricity.
We use finite element method(MATLAB PDE Toolbox) combined with Distmesh for simulation. The governing equation is ▽(σ▽u)=-Iδ(r), where u denotes the electric potential, σ is the conductivity of the material.
